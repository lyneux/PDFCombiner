PDFCombiner
===========

A small java utility designed to be run from the command line that combines PDFs in a source directory together based on the number of pages within the PDF.

For example, if the source directory contains 4 PDFs, two with 1 page and two with 2 pages, the output will be two PDFs, one containing the documents with 1 page and the other containing the documents with two pages.
